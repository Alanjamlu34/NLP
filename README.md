> [!WARNING]
> The notebook also includes an NLP section for analyzing the reviews. However, due to imbalanced data with too many 5-star ratings (for obvious reasons🥰), the results may not be conclusive. You can explore alternative approaches or use a more diverse dataset for better insights.

Feel free to modify the code, add more features, or adapt it for other films.
Remember to respect website terms of use and guidelines when scraping data.
