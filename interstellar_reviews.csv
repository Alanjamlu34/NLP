pbloo,★★★★★,Watched,"Agora que conheço esse aplicativo e ""paguei"" um curso dele, eu consigo tentar descrever o meu fascínio por este filme. Com o relançamento em setembro, em comemoração aos 10 anos, não pude perder a oportunidade de re-assistir e depois ver nas telonas (tem alguém que está devendo assistir esse filme e isso também é um convite).Este filme me apresentou ao trabalho de Nolan. Não é necessário se aprofundar no elenco impecável, mas o que o McConaughey, a Hathaway e…"

ash_aos,★★★★½,Watched,"Mon nolan préféré je pense. Ultra matrixant quand j'étais plus jeune, trop emouvant matrixant etc. Matthew mcconaughey est ultra crédible, les autres acteurs aussi!"
heresean1127,★★★★★,Watched,This movie is peak for me because I love crazy sci-fi conceptual things like that but also my wife and I got so close over our love for this movie so it holds a special place in my heart has to be five stars Jesus Christ that’s Jason Bourne.

taybuch,★★★★★,Watched,holy shit
alyssarein,★★,Watched,"There were some aspects of this movie that I liked, but overall on a second watch I feel like it's trying too hard to be smart. The characters are only secondary to the buzzwordy scifi jargon, and the plot suffers because of it. A movie being complex doesn't necessarily make it good, and a lot of the plot in this movie has a ""wait run that by me one more time"" energy that demands a lot out of an audience…"
samuellovesmovi,★★★★½,Watched,"Väldigt bra film. Varför? Ljud bra, 4k video, bra skådespelare. Råkar vara så att jag tittar på den nu faktiskt :). Olof gillar inte filmen men jag menar på att den har ett djupare syfte då man kan se den flera gånger och få olika synvinklar. (Typ som Harry Potter med Snaipe)"

ireneeez,★★★★★,Watched,"Madre mía.Nunca había llorado tanto en una película, y sobre todo, no tengo palabras para describirla (literalmente). Pero si la tuviese que describir, sería con una palabra: BELLA, la belleza del amor, de la humanidad, el espacio, la muerte, la familia, la...vida.

isyoj,No rating,Watched,"i gave it a rewatch after a couple of years and a couple more films. and i’m feeling different about it now. i felt, as i often do in Nolan’s work, very well guided through the film but felt no room for interpretation.there’s a very vivid feeling i feel when watching a good film, one that makes life worth living, and i can best describe it as feeling safe in the hands of a good maker. there’s no denying…"
zecobs,★★★★★,Watched,"Esse filme elevou o sci-fi a outro nível. Durante o filme todo tem um mix de sentimentos, de um extremo ao outro. Esse filme dá uma aula de como misturar histórias de pegadas diferentes e conseguir encaixar uma na outra de uma forma incrível. Sua trilha sonora é uma das mais bem feitas da história do cinema. Esse filme dá uma aula de CGI em produções milionárias de hoje em dia. Não há nenhum defeito nesse filme."

thecriticego,★★★★★,Watched,"This movie is also one for the books! From Hans Zimmers magic as a composer to the acting of all of them. This is one of those movies that will stick with you if you allow yourself to be patient, it is a slow burner of a film but boy how it’s worth it in the end. It really is a pivotal movie for the industry! Maybe I’m biased because I’m so into space vibes but I will defend that!!"

shayr,★★★★★,Watched,"Yet again, proves to be my favorite film of all time. Genuinely had me screwed up at 4 in the morning. 10th rewatch btw."
paytonadams,★★★★★,Watched,One of my new favorite movies easily. This movie is straight perfection. I can’t even fathom how talented Christopher Nolan is. I can’t get all my thoughts out in this review. I could talk about it for hours. Here are some thoughts tho:- perfect casting- perfect flow and organization of this movie- shots are excellent- dialogue is perfection- music composition and score perfection- suspense and emotion perfection (I was basically crying the whole movie)…
xotrizah,★★★★★,Watched,I watched this for the first time today at work and I was fighting back tears 😭 Nolan you really ate with this!!! What a masterpiece wow. The fucking cinematography? I’m impressed. Pretty sure this is going to be at the top of my best movies to ever exist list.

grey_days,★★★★★,Watched,The wall robots scared me
zizou212,★★★★★,Watched,"T’as envie de devenir physicien après avoir vu le film. Bonne balance de beaucoup d’éléments de science et de l’irrationalité humaine. De très belles images et les moments de silences dans l’espace font très bien leur effet. Aucun moment de platitude. J’ai soufflé au début quand j’ai vu le film faisait 2h49min mais le temps est relatif. Je sais pas si c’est un classique, mais si s’en est un c’est mérité. 10/10"
armonica69,★★★★★,Watched,"Parfait !Tout est réfléchi, bien fait ! J’éprouve personnellement à regarder ce film pour ces émotions puissantes et sa tram qui est géniale !Si vous ne l’avez pas vu, foncez !!"
willy_amber,★★★★½,Watched,HES IN THE GODDAMN WALLS
quinhopera,★★★½,Watched,Último quarto do filme salva.
eschay,★★★★½,Watched,"Second time around, with a childhood friend who was super into physics. I adamantly recommended this to him 4 years ago, he finally got around to it and loved it.Still super impressed by the visuals, cinematography, and scientific implications. I only realized this time around two things: 1) just how much the tesseract in this movie influences the way I view life, especially being a Christian 2) the essence of humanity that Nolan also captures, which is somewhat overshadowed the first time around by the science and everything else"
seanberry17,★★★★★,Watched,*cums loudly*
catelstorey,★★★★★,Watched,"Mad film! Proper confusing tho at the end, had to get my friend to explain 4th dimensions to me"
erinofori,★★★★★,Watched,not me crying even more on the second watch
jordantolbert18,★★★★★,Watched,It’s almost a necessity to force people who haven’t seen this movie to sit down and watch it and it’s always so rewarding.

flateby,★★★★,Watched,very male yet suprisingly good
molly_forsell,★★★★,Watched,"The only con in this movie was the length. And if it is a really good movie you don’t notice that it’s long which just gave me no choice to give it a 4…But; it was a great movie. Me, who don’t often like movies about space, liked this one but I wouldn’t see it again."

roy_3,★★★★½,Watched,"The alien when the 6-foot, 195 pound human with half a arm and a brain spilling out claws their face off (they thought the indomitable human spirit was fake)least convoluted Nolan film. super incredible and heartwarming tho."
itzzkaam,★★★★,Watched,la vi para un deber xd peeero me gustooo aunque no la vería de nuevo
tommygrant,★★★★½,Watched,Second time watching this film and it was just as amazing the second time around. The visuals and suspense throughout the film are incredible and Matthew McConaughey’s performance was well worth watching!Overall one of Nolan’s best films!
dayvyd_cardoso,★★★★★,Watched,"This review may contain spoilers.I can handle the truth.""Interstellar"",directed byChristopher Nolan, is a masterpiece that combines science fiction with deep philosophical and emotional questions. Set in a future where Earth is on the brink of collapse, former pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) leads a mission to find a new home for humanity. With stunning visual effects based on real scientific theories, notable performances from the cast, and an epic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the film balances visual spectacle with a rich and emotional narrative. ""Interstellar"" is a philosophical exploration of survival, our place in the universe, and the nature of love, inspiring and provoking reflection."
callisto111,★★★★★,Watched,I think I’ll be able to identify my soulmate by the way they react to this movie. One of my favorites of all time. I never finish it without tears streaming down my face. I love this more than life itself.
giorhunting,★★★,Watched,best snooze fest
noircinephile,★★★★★,Watched,"this movie is simply beautiful, a masterpiece: it highlights the importance of cooperation among humans to overcome global challenges, such as climate change and the search for a new home for humanity; it raises existential questions about our place in the universe and the meaning of our existence, especially in relation to humanity's survival. this movie plays with the idea of destiny versus individuals' ability to choose their own path, as shown in the characters' difficult decisions.

nolight8,★★★½,Watched,There is no coming back in time.
krombopulos42,★★★★★,Watched,"Mcconaughey pulls off the emotional gut punch of popping outside for 45 minutes only to come back and find that your daughter has aged 20 years AND when attempting an impossible docking procedure with a spinning space station, replies with the line ""Its not impossible, its necessary"". Legendary status achieved for me. And how else would you show a crazy time gateway in the middle of a blackhole? Bookcase worked for me"
bastasendhelp,★★★★★,Watched,"Yeah, I can understand the hype now."
lpbur,★★★★★,Watched,"Es maravillosa. Una epopeya única. Emocionante y emotiva ( con algunas de las escenas que más me desgarran como espectador), una banda sonora que nos perfora y transmite perfectamente las sensaciones de esos personajes.El reparto esta perfecto, la historia es rompedora, los efectos visuales están a un nivel increible.Mi favorita de Nolan dentro de una docena de títulos estupendos que conforman su filmografía, y quizás una de mis 10 películas favoritas de siempre."

frommertanz,★★★★,Watched,"Quasi selber Plot wie die Pilotepisode von Star Trek Deep Space Nine, nur sind die Menschen hier selbst die Wurmlochwesen. Visuell natürlich beeindruckend und grandios besetzt. Synchron-Highlight: Jürgen Thormann als Professor Brand (gespielt von Michael Caine) - wer auch sonst."

sionasen,★★★★★,Watched,"had been hearing about how good this movie was but hadn’t watched it until now. Definitely very thought provoking and I really enjoyed the storyline. Other than the fact that the acting slayed, I think this movie was one of the first in a while to rlly intrigue me"
proudspacealien,★★★★★,Watched,"Obsessed with this movie. This is the only movie that I keep a running tally on the number of watches I've undertaken. When this movie returned in IMAX this year I was the first in line. I could write a novel on the music alone. The characters mean so much to me & the plot even more. The younger me HATED the ""love"" plotline but that version of me also had no idea how important it'd be to me. Such a beautiful film."
masterpiuce,★★★★★,Watched,"If you're curious about relativity, black holes, and scientifically accurate theories of time, I suggest you watch this. But, you must really focus on the storyline and dialogue to really understand it, so you may need to watch it several times. The movie quite long and slow for me, but if you enjoy the plot, you will find the story very good and worth watching. Sad, awe-inspiring, and even mind-blown moments are all there in this movie.

santoshm,★★★★★,Watched,"my life goal is to master every detail of this movie so when anyone asks me to explain it, i will mansplain my knowledge"
isaiah_raya,★★★★★,Watched,Crazy how this is the my first time watching this movie in its entirety and much to Mr. Nolan’s dismay its on my phone aboard a plane. I still teared up multiple times and felt the claustrophobia and turbulence all the same (if not a bit more for some of those).
1747263,★★★★★,Watched,"Bellissimo film, molto emotivo, bello anche il momento, lo ricordo con molto piacere"

daniel_v_v,★★★★,Watched,jeg kan godt lide at tro på den ukuelige menneskelige ånd. jeg tænker romantiske tanker om hvad fremtidige generationer af menneskeheden kan opnå af teknologiske vidundere blandt stjernerne. den her film kradser min kløe for at se badass mennesker erobre universet.
aidandresang,★★★★,Watched,Made me so existential about life. Also really valid questions about the meaning of space travel and why we should be focusing on sustaining earth. Why are we trying to colonize other galaxies? The next frontier…

giovannadias_28,★★★★★,Watched,"Não tem como não se emocionar com esse filme, toda a história e o plot foram muito bem escritos e desenvolvidos, o Nolan se superou tanto nessa obra que até a imagem do buraco negro que ele usou é utilizada como exemplo em universidades, simplesmente, surreal o talento desse cara e de toda a equipe envolvida nesse projeto. Ainda acho que esse filme deveria ter levado o Oscar, mas Oppenheimer veio aí pra fazer justiça pelo reconhecimento do trabalho do Nolan kkkkk"

quayequaye,★★★★★,Watched,wow i have no words that was fantastic
brickwallp,★★★★★,Watched,Interstellar ages like fine fifth dimensional wine in a time loop. Truly is better with every watch.
maaaaaattt,★★★★,Watched,"Ok fine it’s better than I thought, but it still takes itself too seriously and the self aggrandizing screenwriting sounds corny as fuck coming from Matthew McConaughey."

diabolicalloki,★★★★★,Watched,"Some movies are just so good you can't even write reviews, and this is most certainly one of them.Can't help it but tear up at the end.Nolan is a master at crafting emotions, and this movie is the perfect example for it.If you don't like this movie, then I don't like you :)"

bofei,★★★★★,Watched,Probably my most favorite movie of all time. Everything is on point from storyline to visuals. The self-sacrifice element makes me love and appreciate my family even more.
rc3sidoli,★★★★★,Watched,"I mean yeah, it’s just one of those movies. A classic that everyone knows is good, and it’s not til your sat there watching it feeling feelings that maybe someone 200 years will feel from now to realize how it earned that reputation. Music, visuals, story, it’s something you watch not knowing how the execution managed to match the ambition, but somehow Nolan did it. Matthew did strap Timothee down into the parent-child love driven plot cuck chair though."
cynthialeyva,★★★★★,Watched,"Mi frase favorita de la peli es “que el amor es la única cosa que podemos percibir y que trasciende dimensiones de tiempo y espacio”Pienso que definitivamente es una película majestuosa, y el soundtrack de fondo tmb lo es, me eriza la piel cada vez que la veo y me impresiona mucho como la realidad humana siempre estará enfocada en lo cuantificable que es el amor, en todo aquello que sabemos hacer y en todo lo que estamos por conocer."

lxbranco,★★★★★,Watched,"What a perfect film- a sci-fi odyssey like no other.Even though i’ve seen this movie a dozen times; I still feel every bit of tension, every bit of fear, but still i am amazed at how grand and exciting Nolan is able to capture space travel.The cast for this movie is perfect and absolutely stacked from head to toe.The ending always has me tearing up, god damn.Fuck Matt Damon."

Recently, I decided to give it another chance, and this time, it made me emotional in ways I hadn't anticipated. Christopher Nolan's 2014 epic is not just a visual masterpiece, but a deeply moving exploration of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit.Staring stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer in a dystopian future where Earth…"

With urgency chasing the cast, the slow start is appreciated and complimentary to a stress-inducing and heartfelt journey beyond our conceptions of space.This film will always make me cry with just 5 words, I'm sure you know what they are.Nolan and Zimmer may just be the greatest team in cinema."

I don't want to compare these two movies because they're very different in tone and intention, but watching one right after the other made this Nolan epic feel very flat.The subplot of Earth ending is so uninteresting that it hurts.

eggmanifold,★★★★★,Watched,"InterstellarThe film not only captivates with its visuals and sound but also forms a deep emotional connection with the audience. The viewers themselves emotionally entangled with the characters, feeling the weight of their sacrifices and the urgency of their mission.My favourite scenes were : Cooper witnessing his children age rapidly due to the time dilation effect. The sadness on his face as he was watching the videos of his children creates an emotional resonance, emphasising the sacrifice inherent…"

muetzenman,★★,Watched,"It took me 10 Years to finally watch this movie beloved by so many. And it was...mid. (Jonathan) Nolan isn't good at writing Characters to care about, so none of the emotional scenes hit with me. The soundtrack was really cool but blared so loud and the dialogue was so silent. It was really annoying. And the Story was... a foreshadowing for the bonkers pretentious story we got with Tennet. I spent three hours with this movie and had to…"

Interstellar é um ótimo filme para quem gosta de temas sci-fi, característico do diretor em trazer sempre obras repletas de detalhes minuciosos que muitas vezes exigem não só atenção ao enredo, mas também um conhecimento específico. Este é claramente um dos melhores exemplos de filmes já feitos para sua categoria, contando com uma trilha sonora perfeita. Talvez não seja recomendado para quem prefere roteiros ultra-realistas. Apesar de 96% dos dados serem baseados em ciência para alcançar um alto nível de veracidade, algumas ações e situações não condizentes com a realidade foram necessárias para manter o roteiro envolvente."

I'm not even a Mathew McCoughnahay fan but he is great in this and Jessica Castain is also. That one scene always gets me crying. The use of relativity and the concept of black holes and wormholes is very cool and speaks to my inner nerd and the program used to generate the black hole apparently led to scientific advancements in the field of cosmology. This movie is awesome, my favorite Nolan movie, so good. The ending gets me."

All of the dialogue here is also exceptional especially with the hard-hitting scenes and it continues to deliver impact throughout the work."

rub3n_g4,★★★★★,Watched,"The end of a Christopher Nolan movie is what makes it a Christopher Nolan movie, the realisation between the real world and the movie, that last half an hour of the movie where everything comes to sense that moment you are living inside the movie that moment when you aren't in this world but in Nolan's world that moment is what perfection feels like that moment is Christopher Nolan."

dario_lover,★★★★★,Watched,"I love this movie, Solid 110/10. Christopher Nolan is a genius in cinema. The storyline follows a father who finds a nasa Space station & is chosen to go on a mission to go and find other alternatives for earth. The twist in this masterpiece of the Sci-fi sub genre is actually crazy and sinister. The ending is really sad and never fails to make me cry no matter how much I watch it. (I won’t spoil it for people who haven’t watched it.)"

The lights and sounds are pretty, but critical plot beats hinge on obvious bullshit, and for a movie that demands 3 hours that feels unfairly manipulative."

adog01,★★★★★,Watched,Probably my favorite movie. Something about the vastness of space and they way they portrayed how small we are resonated with me. This movie seemed very tangible and realistic in the event we have to leave Earth. The cinematography was the best I’ve seen I mean they had a 163 million dollar budget! This is probably Mathew McConaughey’s best performance both as a father trying to save his family and to save mankind. Definitely a must watch if you haven’t seen it.
geowlovr,★★★★★,Watched,"“Você era meu fantasma.”Que plot twist foi esse. Eu só tenho uma coisa a dizer: da mesma forma que a física é assustadora e sem sentido, ela é linda.“O tempo é relativo.”Ele literalmente conseguiu distorcer o tempo e entrando em um tipo de dimensão.O TEMPO É RELATIVO.Não foram outros seres que criaram isso, foram humanos mais evoluídos.FILMES CIENTÍFICOS SÃO INCRÍVEISQuero assistir esse filme quantas vezes precisar, ainda tenho muita duvidas sobre ele, mas definitivamentefoi um dos melhores filmes já feitos no cinema."

ixoleen,★★★★½,Watched,"I think any good director or writer can make a good film from pure conjecture and imagination, but I love when a film director goes above and beyond to put research behind everything. Sure, a lot of parts in this film might not be totally scientifically feasible, but it seems to both play with and respect real theories and conditions. I think that’s why this film feels so game-changing.Also, it’s kind of incredible that somehow the whole world is at stake, and we just want Cooper to watch Murphy and Tom grow up."

Donde literalmente lo veo necesario para procesar todo y poder seguir existiendo despues de ver la pelicula, me paso exactamente lo mismo con peliculas anteriores de Cristopher Nolan.Esta claro que al final la salvan a la mina, no esta adaptada para tener una segunda parte, con su permiso voy a morir de la angustia, ninguna peli me va a dejar igualpd: la voy a ver 999 veces mas antes de morir"
spidewebr,★★★★½,Watched,"This review may contain spoilers.I can handle the truth.Me encantó, la confusión combinada con el asombro fue algo que me produjo euforia al terminar la película, mi escena favorita fue totalmente la de los libros. Si te gusta la física o las teorías del espacio tiempo esta película es para tí. Recalco que al principio yo la sentí lenta, pero con el tiempo te vas involucrando cad vez más. Destaco la banda sonora y sobretodo el como se veía la película, partes impresionantes como cuando entra al agujero negro y el espacio tiempo se empieza a deformar son admirables. De mis favoritas de Nolan."

tommy0711,★★★★,Watched,"Visivamente straordinario e con una delle colonne sonore più iconiche di tutti i tempi, di Hans Zimmer. Le interpretazioni degli attori sono eccellenti e il tema del legame familiare è molto emozionante. Anche se a tratti la trama può risultare complicata, ""Interstellar"" offre un'esperienza cinematografica coinvolgente e spettacolare. Da vedere."
freakrighthere,★★★★★,Watched,i should have watched this in theatres in imax instead of being in kindergarten
engineertq,★★★,Watched,"Having not seen this since it released in theatres almost 10 years ago, I thought it was time to revisit and reevaluate one of my all time biggest movie disappointments ever.I still appreciate Nolan's craftsmanship and the visuals of the film and found I enjoyed the movie more overall this time. I still despise the entire Murphy plot and anything related to the bookshelf communication, 4th dimensional nonsense. All of Jessica Chastain's dialogue is still really terrible.For me this is still Nolan's worst film, but I don't feel the same contempt for it that I did last time I watched it."
mikemacalintal,★★★,Watched,The blight is still one of the dumbest plot devices but Hans Zimmer did carry.

The whole going into the black whole i didn’t really get… like there had to be some science fiction there bc we’ve obviously never been in one but that was interesting. bulk bodies? tesseract? anyhow… how’d he get back? or out? i just don’t get it. but very good."
donpablovp,★★★★,Watched,"Love a good “realistic” sci fi movie, very bittersweet, long film but pacing was fresh. McConaughey is a G, the robots are G’s, visually stunning, great score and it has the Neil Degrasse Tyson stamp of approval👏🏽"

michaelcalia,★★★,Watched,"This one was a letdown when I first saw it nearly a decade ago, and it still doesn't quite work despite some truly moving and profound moments and ideas. Along with Tenet, which gets more points for at least being a hilarious brainiac riff on Michael Bay and James Bond, it's best to appreciate Interstellar as sort of a sketch book for ideas that Nolan would really nail in Oppenheimer, which is a goddamn all-timer."

Évidemment Hans Zimmer à la musique est exceptionnel. Tout est bien pensé tout est cohérent et on pourrait croire qu'il s'agit d'un documentaire sur comment marche notre univers de façon certaine !

samirakazi,★★★★★,Watched,Now I understand why it is so highly rated and top of people's favs after watching it on the big screen. Thank you Star Cineplex for re-releasing this gem. I'm sorry Sir Nolan for all the times I've said interstellar is not among the good ones.Had Goosebumps and shivered through a lot of scenes.100/100 no doubt.

I'm with my parents in Victoria, BC Canada and while we were at the museum today, I noticed they were playing Interstellar in the evening on their IMAX screen so my mom and I came back to see it! The only convincing my mom needed was that Matthew McConaughey is in it. The last time I saw this movie in full was 10 years ago when it first came out. I know a lot folks really like this one and I think still really like it too."

Pois chega um momento que o telespectador não consegue ficar mais preso ao filme pois já tem todas as respostas e já sabe como vai ser o fechamento.Assistam as análises desse filme pois ajuda a entender bem mais e perceber algumas coisas que na hora passa despercebido.

amirsabbah,★★★★★,Watched,It doesn’t get better than this. Many scenes had me in tears. The way it is able to connect the reality of our world with the theoretical aspects we still are uncertain of allow this movie to become a masterpiece which we will never see again. To make such a theoretical field so realistic and connect all of the things that make humans human in it baffles me. Perfection. There is no other way to describe it. The emotional touch it is able to make you feel is beyond me. Left in tears in the end. Perfect wallah. Too much.

natyspace,★★★★★,Watched,"esse filme é completamente PERDEITOeu passaria horas escrevendo sobre a cinematografia, caracterização, atuação, TUDO TUDOTUDOMESMOmas eu prefiro dizer que não importam quantas vezes eu veja, eu vou chorar pra um caramba(única coisa que estragou a experiência foi ter assistido com meu pai engraçadinho que a cada 6 minutos fazia uma piada.)“O amor é a única coisa perceptível que transcende o tempo e o espaço.”"

peedjar,★★★★,Watched,"Chris Nolan has such a grasp on how smart and attentive his audience can be his job almost becomes reduced to keeping their attention. He's never trying to pull one on you or distract, everything is always moving forward and has implications and he rewards the audience for believing in that sincerity.P.S I want the inside baseball on how directors describe what they want from a music score"

mily_tory,½,Watched,"Antes de ver esse filme eu tinha uma ideia bem ruim a respeito dele, e depois de assistir eu vi que estava certa.É mais um filme megalomaníaco do Nolan, que ele faz para acariciar o ego dele. É chato e muito longo, o drama é ruim, o roteiro se força para parecer super inteligente e genial, quando não verdade não é.Acho que quem trabalha com astronomia e física talvez goste, eu achei fraquíssimo e superestimado, um filme bem Nolan."

Want to watch again while everything is still fresh. Another thing I'll say is that I always had this feeling of this moving being a massive epic, long run time, covering an entire history. On rewatch, it's pretty breezy! Zips by before you notice. There really isn't that much time in the spaceship, to be honest."

I think Matthew McConaughey puts on a brilliant performance. The way that this film can both wow you with the cinematography as well as having a deep story that is extremely emotional is special. I do think the pacing could have been a little better, as it does meander just a bit in the middle of the film.…"

rayabae,★★★★★,Watched,in my opinion the second greatest film of all time (after oppenheimer) this is a movie that has never failed to make me cry even though ive watched it so many times. and like a chris nolan classic movie i really dint understand the ending until 3 watches. the fact i love these movies is because i can make so many theories about the movie and theryre all mess with my mind

tyronedw3rd,No rating,Watched,"Finally, the greatest film of all time, according to the legions of glazers that stalk this website. I don't think there is a film I have seen on Letterboxd that has SO MANY people place it at numero uno. I remember when I first watched this movie, I must have been in 8th grade, and my friend put it on, but he quickly fell asleep. I stayed up into the night, watching the behemoth runtime of 169 minutes for a…"
vaction,★★★★,Watched,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think that it managed to pull at some emotion in the last half hour that makes me feel like I enjoyed it more than I actually did. I feel like this movie suffers from some of Christopher Nolan's usual things (having a vague sci-fi premise that gets explained away, having sound that goes up and down in volume so greatly that I need to rewind some parts to hear properly and then…"
mwarstep,★★★★½,Watched,"This is an absolute ride from start to finish! The visuals? Mind-blowing. The score by Hans Zimmer? Gives me chills every single time. Nolan has this incredible ability to make you feel like you’re right there with the characters, experiencing the vastness of space and the depth of their emotions.Matthew McConaughey is GREAT. The scenes where he’s torn between his mission and his family hit hard. And don’t even get me started on the mind-bending science and those epic…"
julian65,★★★½,Watched,"Thought provoking but overlong sci fi film with impressive special effects including powerful imaginings of cosmic scientific concepts through encounters with wormholes and black hole event horizon Affecting score by Hans Zimmer and video message segments provide some, but arguably insufficient emotional heart and drama around themes of love, sacrifice and time slipping by. The film’s four dimensional tesseract segment strongly indebted to Kubrick’s 2001 star child sequence. Intelligent robot TARS’ design appears to  reference alien monolith from 2001: a space odyssey and provides interesting contrast with HAL from Kubrick’s masterpiece."

joak__1,★★★,Watched,La bande originale c’est un 10/10 mais prendre dans l’équipe de réalisation un scientifique spécialisé dans les trous noirs pour au final faire n’importe quoi avec la physique à la fin du film c’est dommage.Sinon pratiquement tous les acteurs au top.La scène où Cooper regarde tous les messages de ses enfants..🥲
leftydirecty,★★★★★,Watched,"Watching this in the IMAX had confirmed that this is indeed Nolan’s best and it’s kind of not even close. There is nothing more satisfying than sitting in a packed theater, watching a ten-year-old movie, and participating in group gasps at the sheer scope of it all. I cried no less than 5 times, and yeah it might’ve been the estrogen, but it also might have been the pure majesty of cinema.Surprise Bad Damon should play sniveling toad characters more often."

rodzz,★★★★½,Watched,"Com grande inspiração em 2001, uma odisseia no espaço, essa é uma das melhoras ficções científicas da história. O que faz esse filme estar nesse patamar é a genialidade do nolan na construção das cenas sem efeitos especiais e nas situações que ele bota os personagens que fascinam o espectador. Além disso temos a melhor atuação da carreira do Matthew McConaughey, ele entregou tudo na cena que ele vê as mensagens dos filhos. Esse filme é uma obra prima que eu vou continuar revendo e revendo pra sempre."

cabe_w,★★★★★,Watched,"We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.My first viewing of this film I titled as great. I must have been in a bad mood.Music and overtures, visual dynamics, character performances, written dialogue, and story. A successful combination of essential factors to form a marvelous film. Sheer scale is measured by intimate character portraits, balancing to create a gripping narrative of Shakespearean sci-fi storytelling, a sequential and visual masterpiece. Truly awe-some."

Es tut mir leid für diejenigen, die es nicht können – für die, die nicht erleben können, was der Film als Erlebnis bietet, es aber verweigern. Das Gefühl, das dieser Film vermittelt, wird bis zum Tod bestehen. Niemals wird es einen Film mehr geben, der mit den Maßstäben von Interstellar vergleichbar sein wird."

Really insanely fantastic movie. I was very stimulated and invested! A good signifier of this is the fact i barely picked up my phone to play games (I’m a toddler). The space and planet visuals were also very stunning.

Es muy buena, aunque predecible en ocasiones. Diría que está sobrevalorada solo por mi decepción pero sería ir demasiado lejos. Y la banda sonora es maravillosa.Me da risa como se pasa por los huevos a su propio hijo, le dan tanto foco a su lazo con la hija que el mayor es simplemente un cualquiera."

I watched this film regularly because I find it immerses me. Feels like a character study on humans from an outside of perspective.

vtshoto,★★½,Watched,"Interstellarhas a unique notoriety surrounding it, leaving little margin for a viewer to fall into between the a swirl of generalization surrounding its impact. I will always respect Nolan's ability to inject his entries to modern Hollywood with spectacle and ambition, however relative to other offerings of his, this resides in more of a speculative state than an accomplished one, falling short in its ability to provoke or compel.It would be remiss to insinuate thatInterstellaris without…"

bigdyl2004,★★★★★,Watched,This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The first time I watched this movie was at home. I was not lucky enough to watch it in theaters the first time. Since then I have watched this movie 7 times and have just recently watched it in theaters. I didn’t think this movie could get any better for me. This is Nolan’s BEST. Phenomenal movie.

You’re telling me they discovered how to create all this INTERSTELLAR black hole-derived technology, and they can’t prevent blight ridden corn. Jeez!Note for you here, Chrisy boy, maybe instead of spending so much time working with NASA with your black hole, you could have picked up the phone and called Monsanto."

I wouldn’t say there’s anything dumb in this movie but there’s defiantly some interesting decisions made, good and questionable. But it really doesn’t take away from the rest of the movie because it’s heat and the cinematography is nearly if not better than Oppenheimers. Space. I like the ending. Peace out bye!"

It's really no wonder why people celebrate it as much as they do."

ydlovesmovies,★★★★½,Watched,"I find it funny how Nolan clearly didn’t care much about the scientific mechanisms behind this story yet that’s what most focus on when viewing. Like what do you mean love is the secret key to communicating past time? We got YouTube video analysts making content on that as if Nolan studied Einstein’s work to perfect the science in his galactic love story.Anyways, I appreciate this way more on a second viewing. Likely Nolan’s most emotional story."
lxspiers,★★★★½,Watched,This man is a master of capturing the grandness of the universe. The visuals here are awe inspiring and you can really feel how most of the images are organic and not digital. I think in 30 years we are going to be looking back at the visual aspects of this film and comparing it to many of the greats before it. What Nolan lacks in character writing and storytelling he more than exceeds himself in world building. I wish that I had got a chance to see this in IMAX.

jacobgarcia,★★★★,Watched,"Interstellaris an epic film that feels like the journey of a lifetime.If there’s one thing Nolan writes well, it’s stakes. The central mission of the protagonist carries so much weight, I was on the edge of my seatprayingfor the central characters to survive.The weight this film carries can mostly be attributed to the fact that it takes its time. I love how the 1st act fully fleshes out the primary relationship between father and daughter, and for the…"
dubrillo,★★★★½,Watched,Took a bit to get going but once it did it was really good. Can’t imagine what a cinema experience would have been like. Some of the tensest moments in a film. I love the robots
shotnchaserpod,★★★★★,Watched,"Woah... is this his best?? Nolan, McConaughey, Damon, Zimmerman, everyone is firing on all cylinders. The scope of this story is so sprawling. Everyone is doing their absolute best under the direction of Nolan. Love this from start to finish. On par with 2001. We just don't get many movies like this."

Esse é o filme mais injustiçado da história do Oscar.Um dos pontos fortes do longa reside no desenvolvimento profundo dos seus personagens, especialmente o protagonista Cooper, interpretado por Matthew McConaughey. Cooper é um piloto e engenheiro que embarca em uma missão interestelar para encontrar um novo lar para a humanidade, deixando para trás seus filhos em uma Terra moribunda.

El duro trabajo de Cristopher Nolan se ve obligado en este filme, desde ingeniar un agujero negro jamás visto, hasta los más pequeños detalles lo hacen un directorexcepcional.Escenas devastadoras, momentos de tensión y agonía hasta escenas irreales vuelven esta película en una de las mejores jamás vistas por mí."

keegan_clark,★★★★★,Watched,"Just perfect. The soundtrack, the character development, the cinematography, the story, the twist ending. A lot of movies recently like to push 3 hours, but so many of them just don’t need that much to tell the story. Interstellar is definitely an exception though. It’s all deliberately laid out for 169 min, and was never boring."

It still hits as Nolan's best.Though perhaps slightly overrated, it is still a phenomenal acheivement and a landmark in filmmaking history and, maybe, human history in general.

Himself and Tarantino are great at taking what others have done, and in most cases done better and repackaging it for a wider western audience."

These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, that our destiny lies above us.”Simply…"

marcellabruni,★★★★★,Watched,"vai ser difícil colocar toda essa experiência em palavras. esse filme é genial, impecável, absurdo e imprevisível. cada detalhe foi muito bem pensado, as emoções dos personagens foram perfeitamente transmitidas e a música faz eu me arrepiar inteira todas as vezes. assistir esse filme pela primeira vez é surreal, mas assistir pela segunda vez dentro de um avião, olhando o pôr do sol, um arco-íris e uma lua cheia pela janela, não teve comparação. me senti dentro do filme, achei que eu ia flutuar quando a trilha sonora começou a tocar. não existe nada igual, esse filme é único."

But, I probably won't be watching it again because I didn't particularly love the vibes. Also, Matthew McConaughey's character really went forth and repeatedly demonstrated that he loved his daughter more than his son, which is bad parenting on all fronts."

bertyrick01,★★★½,Watched,Top 3 Christopher Nolan movie. This movie is complex and not for those who partly pay attention to movies. The visuals and soundtrack of this movie is absolutely stunning and in a league of its own. It has beautifully complex plot twist and intense scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend but must pay close attention or you will get lost.

joacofel,★★★★★,Watched,COMO ES QUE RECIEN LA VEO POR PRIMERA VEZ AHORAA? Dios mio es una obra maestra. Diría que lo mejor de Christopher Nolan. Es mucha ciencia y física por momentos pero igualmente se re entiende. Es increíble.A la par de Denis Villeneuve creo que Christopher Nolan es de los mejores directores de ciencia ficción. Demostró que puede trabajar en diversos géneros y este sabe hacerlo perfectamente.La trama es increíble. No exagerado en lo futurista lo cual lo hace…
hugoscaderai,★★★★★,Watched,"Acho um ótimo filme, muitos dizem não sentir o efeito do drama quando é colocado em prática pelo Nolan mas eu ao menos sinto.Gosto de como o tema sobre amor é tratado aqui, apesar de não ser revolucionário e até pobre se parar pra pensar.Tecnicamente é majestoso, agrada muito aos olhos de quem vê (sabendo ou não de cinema)"

bentondodd,★★★★★,Watched,"A truly grand visual spectacle from Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema paired with some of Hans Zimmer's best work captivates the audience from the get-go until the soaring finish.The collapsing world of our near future feels uncomfortably plausible, and the science is (mostly) believable. The action is gripping, with some of the set pieces defying imagination. But despite the epic galaxy-spanning scope of the film, it's real triumph is in the little details and touching moments. A…"
gemzini,★★★★★,Watched,"This review may contain spoilers.I can handle the truth.Ich liebe es einfach dass der Kern dieser Handlung, um eine Reise durch Galaxien zur Rettung der Menschheit, einfach ist dass es für Liebe keine Grenzen gibt, vorallem nicht zwischen Eltern und ihren Kindern.

sarafernandessz,★★★★★,Watched,"Masterpiece.Tudo nesse filme é simplesmente brilhante. A trilha sonora, o roteiro, as atuações, (...) praticamente tudo é perfeito ou perto de ser. O facto de o pai não ter acompanhado toda a vida de seus filhos quebra qualquer pessoa. O jeito que nada fazia sentido e de repente o final entrega tudo ou até mais daquilo que não entendiamos ao longo do filme também foi genial. A forma que toda a ciência espacial é retratada é tão maravilhosa ao ponto de até eu, que não sou fã de filmes sobre esse tema, conseguir ficar apaixonada por tudo que nele é retratado. Simplesmente uma obra prima."

richi2002cr,★★★★,Watched,"Visualmente perfecta, si a Nolan no se le hubiera ido tanto la pinza con el final sería un 9 seguramente. Cuanto más pasan los años, menos me gusta el estilo de dirección de este hombre, el ritmo frenético constante sin dejar respirar a las escenas y no permitiendo a los actores brillar. La necesidad de complicar la trama de una forma absurda y mentiendo un montón de terminos que no entiende nadie, para luego saltarte cualquier explicación de las cosas necesarias como el mundo que has creado o escenas que sólo visualmente no quedan claras."

tiderider,★★★★½,Watched,"Deftly weaves a father/daughter relationship saga throughout the physics of a cosmic exploration for survival, though there's meaningful time with others, also. Plenty of ruminations on man's existence and search for place & meaning, whether on Earth, with others or in another galaxy. Some moments that are a bit too earnest, with similar moments that hit the right note. Big and bold with a few moments that don't quite fit, but it's a gigantic movie that earns its director's reputation."

christroller360,★★★,Watched,a bit too corny cornball for me. I’m not a big fan of Anne Hathaway as an actress and this suffers from the same thing that the first Thor movie does — too much stuff is going on back on earth that I don’t care as much about. I also don’t like that dylan thomas poem. But regardless the space stuff was just insane and super well done visually. Loved TARS and CASE and matthew mcconaughey is good as always.
serhanyoshi,★★★★★,Watched,"One of the best movies I’ve watched. Encaptured my attention throughout, even throughout the mid portion of the movie. Emotional, had me on the edge of my seat and had me thinking about it long after the movie. Really one of the movies I’ve gone “Wow.” After. It blends science and rationality with human emotion so well. Acting is phenomenal, I love Matthew McConaughey. Overall 5 star movie, one of the best. Nolan’s the goat"

Mathew Meconoha was amazing and I didn’t like Mann very much I mean he is supposed to be super smart but I can’t figure out how to work an airlock.

The silence, the sights, the scenery. Along with the thrown in twists, yet there being no “villain”. Just different attempts to save the human race. All tied together with something that was kind of predictable, but done so well it didn’t matter. And icing on the cake, soundtrack by the one and only Hans Zimmer. Perfection"

This is one of the most visually stunning films, maybe ever, with one of the best film scores, maybe ever, and it features some of the most breathtaking sci-fi sequences ever put to film."

One of Nolan’s best outings and it’s just so so very well crafted. McConaughey was wonderful but honestly the whole cast was. Hathaway always delivers too. The movie really had such a great sense of cosmic grand adventure with so much dread thrown in. Easily could right a novel about this movie but will try to wrap it…

The film's stellar cast, led by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, delivers powerful performances that resonate on both an emotional and intellectual level. With its ambitious…"

armaanykhokha,★★★★½,Watched,"Completely forgot how good this is. An emotional and surrealist journey through the cosmos. I don’t think I’ve ever been this emotional during a Nolan film before, definitely his best in that regard. The film is (of course) absolutely stunning, coupled with one of the best original scores of the century. This, I remember, was one of the first films that got me into cinema, and, believe it or not, used to be my favorite film. But as time passes, I don’t really see it as the flawless film if once was, but that still doesn’t mean I don’t love and appreciate it."

_gusm_,★★★★½,Watched,"Filme sensacional, mas que pra mim o final deixa a desejar em alguns aspectos, além de parte do roteiro ser muuuuuuito piegas e isso não ser bem fundamentado em tela. Ele tenta gerar emoção, mas isso é mais dito do que mostrado e fica muito brega (não quero dar detalhes pra não ser spoiler). Porém isso é só um pequeno detalhe. Se o filme tivesse uma justificativa menos piegas, ou que ela fosse mais convincente, e o final fosse mais consistente (isso porque a ação final do protagonista não faz nenhum sentido porque é quase um furo de roteiro) aí o filme seria perfeito"

sarkis01,★★½,Watched,"Interestelar é um filme perfeito pra um adolescente de 14 anos que acabou de adentrar no mundo das dições científicas, contanto, está longe de ser um filme bom. São inúmeros os problemas presentes no filme, além da trama não coerente e por muitas vezes contraditórias, essa ambientação extremamente séria que o filme tenta ter, só atrapalha a si mesmo, quando você percebe que os conceitos de viajem no tempo são do mesmo nível que os usados em ultimato. E ele tentar te empurrar um ideia que ele é um filme para só mentes inteligentes, só deixa isso mais engraçado."

I do really like Matthew mconaughey and Anne Hathaway but it just didn’t do it for me. I was excited for a space movie and I can’t put my finger on it but I wasn’t into this one. The ending was sweet but not my idea of a perfect ending. I don’t love when…

caslito7519,★★★,Watched,"Nice visuals and an excellent soundtrack. The Earth is dying, but we don't know why. The visuals of space, black holes, and far-off planets are absolutely stunning and make the movie worth watching for that alone.But fair warning: The movie can get a bit tedious. It's nearly three hours long, and there are parts that feel like they're dragging.The emotional scenes are hit or miss. Interstellar is a mixed bag. It's visually stunning and has some really cool ideas, but it can be a bit heavy and slow in parts."
eyeout4meliner,★★★★,Watched,"Matthew’s range of emotions and Nolan’s use of sound makes this film fucking amazing. The pacing in the beginning was phenomenal, however, it lost flow towards the end."

wetraindrops,★★★★★,Watched,My dad bought the 4K so I got to experience this EVENT of a movie for the first time on the tv with surround sound (I’m sorry but my dad insisted on watching it!)I was confused AS HELL because as usual Christopher Nolan twisted my brain into a pretzel in the best way. But the more I think the more I realize the importance of gravity (and love) as opposed to time and space. It’s brilliant in a movie…

ahmedkandil,★★★★★,Watched,"""Love is the only thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space""This phrase summarizes the whole idea of this movie, the connection of love, that connection that brought Cooper back to Murph, and why she was sure that he would be back, just because her dad promised her, that connection that made Brand believe that Edmund's planet is the one that that they had to choose over Mann's just because she trusts her heart…"

Watching this is like a punch to the stomach but with butterflies and unicorns exploding after bc that’s the beauty of life and this is what I have to accept and I’m so grateful for Christopher Nolan for making the best movie in existence. The power of love is so strong. Gives me hope. Thank you. Can’t believe this isn’t in my top four it’s moving back.

uziorex,★★★★,Watched,"I never kept a good memory of that film when I first watched it in high school. Felt long, over complicated, borderline boring.However, after maturing a bit for a few years, only one thing now seems justified: the over complication. The use of complex vocabulary, explanations and theories forced us to shut our brains and not think twice about… everything. Why did Cooper sent the exact same message that did not work the first time, instead of useful data?…"

La cuestión del amor es la parte de más ciencia ficción de la película, incluso hasta un poco absurda. Efectos visuales impresionantes, una de las mejores actuaciones de lloro en el cine y una trama muy bien llevada a cabo. Hans Zimmer es uno de los goats."

Apesar de a motivação não ser tão clara para a missão, e o mundo ser tão pouco explorado no filme. Muitas pessoas gostam do filme e muitas outras irão gostar, tais como eu que demorei anos pra assistir o filme."

mayamonte,★★★★½,Watched,"wow i mean i thought that he was just gonna go to the moon or something. didn’t realize he was gonna go to another dimension, make me tear up a little bit in the meanwhile, go to another planet, make me tear up again, and then head back on out to space. the soundtrack was also great. it’s just a long one Mr. Nolan."
salsolis,★★★★★,Watched,"A movie that makes me think past what we know the truth is, really sparks my imagination! That plus a great cast and story, it’s an all time for me."
mahantoniia,★★,Watched,He was a bad father.. oh wait.. he wasn’t even there to be able to be a bad father 🤷🏻‍♀️

nocturnhell_,★★★★★,Watched,"existe um antes e um depois de assistir esse filme.se fosse descrevê-lo em apenas uma palavra, seria ""fascínio"".acho que nunca senti a sensação de que algo me engrandeceu, de que me acrescentou, como esse filme.tudo estava interligado, lei de murphy, tudo que pode acontecer, vai acontecer.mesmo no fim, tudo que somos são as nossas memórias, nossos momentos são o que realmente importa.a solidão, o medo, a incerteza, a esperança, a saudade, são tantos sentimentos, impossível…"

hairlesswookiee,★★★★★,Watched,"I’m fairly sure the last time I watched this movie was 10 years ago in theaters, and boy howdy did 14-year-old me not grasp the deep sadness of this movie in the SLIGHTEST. I was not prepared to be continually emotionally sucker punched for two and a half hours.Whenever I have kids, I need to avoid this movie like the plague because I’m pretty sure if I watched this while fully comprehending the weight of leaving your own child…"
tvoty1215,★★★★★,Watched,Holy shit. That was intense. Fuck yeah. Why did it take me so long to watch that. Greatest movie of all time.

realbatman_y,★★★★★,Watched,One of the best movies I've ever seen from the first minute to the last.Absolutely great
alc07,★★★★,Watched,Leaving Anne Hathaway on that planet by herself enrages me and had me in tears
carvalhobr,★★★★★,Watched,"Kino.Pode até ser argumentado que essa parada de ""o poder da amizade é a 5ª dimensão do universo"" é meio cafona, mas, pra mim, vale tudo quando se fala desses conceitos de física que não conhecemos (e provavelmente nunca terá como conhecermos), justamente por extrapolar nossas capacidades de abstração e percepção."
heyitsgaby,★★★★½,Watched,the space stuff is the side plot
vilhelmine,★★★★★,Watched,ive had the strongest urge to rewatch this movie ever since mikha told me that this is her favorite

jamieobrienn,★★★★½,Watched,Can’t believe it took me this long to watch the movie. This was so unbelievably well done and Matthew McNaughay did just a great job with his acting. Only reason I’m give half a star off is because some parts were confusing to understand
pearlfanatic,★★★★★,Watched,WOWWOWOWW SO GOOD
sofir29,★★★★★,Watched,"Omfg, agregado a mi top 3, me explotaron los ojos de tanto llorar"
renanroque,★★★★,Watched,"Para além de toda ficção científica, de todo papo técnico e detalhado que o Nolan faz questão de colocar em seus filmes, interstelar para mim é sobre amor e memórias. E principalmente, sobre luto.O que mais me tocou no filme é o grande drama de não podermos mudar o passado. O tempo só anda para uma direção, ele não permite meia volta. Cooper é obrigado a conviver com o peso da decisão que tomou, e com ela o arrependimento.…"
ethanwright87,★★★★★,Watched,Wow.
sujhin,★★★★★,Watched,"Perfect in every sense. Each scene is a masterpiece, meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in its breathtaking world.

theozinha,★★★,Watched,"reassisti depois de anos hoje e honestamente não lembrava de nada. achei triste, mas achei que poderia ser mais. achei emocionante, mas achei que poderia ser mais. achei bem escrito, mas não me senti surpreendidaas imagens do espaço e a trilha sonora são espetaculares, mas às vezes um pouco chatasgostei mas não amei"
kikiweesie,★★,Watched,i was bored… im sorry
wearyfairy,★★★★★,Watched,"seen it about 200 times in the past year. do not watch if you have daddy issues, or you will also watch it 200 times in one year."
haxroyale_l12,★★★★,Watched,"Great emotional moments, great score, good story. Some of the science gimmicks is done very smartly, but at other times it feels a bit too confusing and convenient. I also feel the movie could have been a bit shorter, some parts are too drawn out and boring. However, the ending is good and overall a very solid movie."
slimjeans69,★★★★★,Watched,Thank you to og kush hemp stiiizy for the strength and courage to finally watch this movie that was at the bottom of my watchlist ever since i got this app

ly_di4s,★★★★★,Watched,this is CINEMA.
persjano,★★,Watched,"This review may contain spoilers.I can handle the truth.Wow. This was weird. I mean I get a sex animation about Scott Pilgrim because it is implied Scott and Ramona have sex at some point when they are together. I always find it funny when fanfics or sex pests add mystical items that make the characters want to have sex and its always just so weird. In this case its a ""chocolate"". Lmfao. Okay? Ramona found it in ""the subspace highway? Fucking sure why not😭. Idk why but the…"

latinharibeiroo,★★★★★,Watched,"This review may contain spoilers.I can handle the truth.CARA MUITO BOM, achei incrível como lidarem com a questão do tempo e a física, me deixou INTRIGADA A PASSAGEM DE TEMPO. Não esperava muito, pensei que seria superstimado porém superou MINHAS EXPECTATIVAS! Toda a questão sobrenatural que o filme aborda, se referindo aos ""eles"" MDSSSS muito foda. Achei comovente, isso porque levei como uma questão pessoal e social de estarmos vivendo um momento de calamidade climática, o que já me deixava pensativa, isso aflorou e virou uma crise existencial."

shielded121,★★★★½,Watched,"Great film. Still pondering the concepts after all these years. Also still probably some pacing issues for me; some of this just takes too long for the payoff. But some incredible images, and the use of silence in space is breathtaking."

tommybx9,No rating,Watched,"Yes okay. Okay. I liked it.I had a lot of problems with it. In general I think it’s very tropey, and I’m not motivated to really care about what’s going on.I don’t really like the characters. I don’t think any performance is particularly good.But there are some great scenes! The ocean scene is really great and exciting.The twist (while being somewhat archetypal, not every movie has to have a twist NOLAN) is interesting enough.The end…"

ac7_filho,★★★★★,Watched,"Interestelar e a arte do cinema.simplesmente uma obra-prima cinematográfica que transcende o gênero de ficção científica. Uma história incrível que explora temas como amor, sacrifício e a busca pela sobrevivência da humanidade, o filme prende o espectador desde o primeiro momento até o último. Christopher Nolan entrega uma obra magistral, combinando efeitos visuais deslumbrantes com uma trilha sonora muitíssimo marcante que ficou ecoando em minha mente por meses, de tão inesquecível. A complexidade da trama, aliada à profundidade dos…"
